## Step 1: **create a _user.py_ file:**
In _user.py_ create a dictionary called user. In user, assign dictionaries such as _PIN_ and _balance_.\
I have entered the PIN value and given the balance as zero(0).Now, I'm creating a dictionary notes and assign required notes.In this case, I have created four \
2000, 500, 200 and 100.

## Step 2: **Create a _withdraw.py_ file:**
In _withdraw.py_ create a class withdraw() and write the function for Withdraw.

## Step 3: Create a _deposit.py_ file:
In _deposit.py_ create a class deposit() and write the function for Deposit.

## Step 4: Create a _balance.py_ file:
In _balance.py_ create a class balance() and write the function for Balance Enquiry.

## Step 5. Create a _main.py_ file':
In _main.py_ for user authentication, I have just used if statement and the condition doesn't satisfied it will throw a exception.\
Then asking the user input for Service as _Deposit, Withdraw, Balance Enquiry and Exit_. Once the user gives a input, it is checked with if condition. \
If any of the condition satisfies then the particular operation is performed. If not a exception is printed.
